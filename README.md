- Note: Sheff 2022 settlement measures demand as Hartford-resident Black and Latino students who apply to at least two magnet schools, or any combination of Open Choice, magnet schools, and tech schools. Chart shows estimates because data that meets demand definition is not yet publicly available. Year refers to lottery application period (e.g. early 2021) for the upcoming school year (e.g. 2021-2022).

Demand refers to the number of on-time and late Hartford-resident applicants who selected at least one magnet school plus Open Choice and/or CTECS; Open Choice and/or CTECS and no magnet schools; or, if applying to magnet schools only, two magnet schools."

- We would prefer that the chart above not focus on Black student versus White student outcomes in magnet schools. Instead, a better measure of quality integrated education inside Sheff schools would be Hartford-resident versus non-Hartford-resident data across a wider range of student outcomes, not just test proficiency. In fact, the Data Transparency and Public Data sections of the [Sheff 2020 settlement](http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=18496368) and the [Sheff 2022 settlement](https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=22109303) require CSDE to share disaggregated student data by town of residence for various outcomes (test performance and growth, attendance, graduation, suspensions and expulsions, etc.). But CSDE has not yet made this type of disaggregated data publicly available.
- To fulfill the terms of the 2022 settlement, CSDE should report disaggregated student data in two larger residential groups---Hartford-residents and non-Hartford-residents---to show meaningful information about educational quality inside Sheff schools, while avoiding small-cell data suppression issues that would arise when reporting individual towns of residence. Furthermore, CSDE should report this disaggregated data by residential group for all Sheff schools, not just interdistrict magnets, as shown below:  

| School Name          | Hartford-resident data | Non-Hartford-resident data |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Magnet School A      |                        |                            |
| Magnet School B      |                        |                            |
| Magnet School C      |                        |                            |
| Open Choice School D |                        |                            |
| Open Choice School E |                        |                            |
| Open Choice School F |                        |                            |
| CT Tech School G     |                        |                            |
